This repository is my attempt at forcing myself to 'eat my vegetables' and gain basic competency in Python. I think trying for a 1-to-1 R translation to Python will be an effective learning method (at least to start) and enshrining it in a Quarto website will keep me rigorous about documenting my process.\n\n## Section Overviews\n\n### Data Wrangling\n\nThe beating heart of my day to day work revolves around data 'wrangling'. I view 'wrangling' as any **scripted** data manipulations between the very first raw data entered digitally and the data being ready for any analysis/visualization. This covers a huge swath of operations and should allow me to explore Python equivalents to many of the R operations that I know and love.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\nI'm not the first to have this idea so there are other useful resources on this topic. See below:\n\n- [ESIIL](https://esiil.org/) (<u>E</u>nvironmental Data <u>S</u>cience <u>I</u>nnovation and <u>I</u>nclusion <u>L</u>ab) has made a workshop attempting to teach this same topic. I anticipate my tutorial will borrow heavily from this resource\n- The [Earth Lab](https://www.earthdatascience.org/) has a Python course that was recommended to me by an NCEAS employee (specifically [section 4](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/python-code-fundamentals/))\n- Dr. Diba Mirza taught a UCSB Computer Science ([CS8](https://ucsb-cs8.github.io/w19-mirza/lectures_list/)) course on Python\n- [Marie Rivers](https://github.com/marierivers) also made [a website](https://marierivers.github.io/marie_quarto/) for exploring Quarto more generally that I've found super helpful for its facet dealing with R/Python bilingualism\n\n\n\n\n\n",
