## Library Loading

Again, we need to begin by loading any needed libraries

:::panel-tabset
## `r fontawesome::fa(name = "r-project", fill = "#FF9B00", a11y = "sem")` R

Load the `tidyverse` meta-package for R operations.

```{r r-libs, warning = F, message = F}
library(tidyverse)
```

## `r fontawesome::fa(name = "python", fill = "#077DC2", a11y = "sem")` Python

Load the Pandas library.

```{python py-libs}
import pandas as pd
```
