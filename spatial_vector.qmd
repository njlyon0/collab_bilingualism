## Library Loading

Before we can dive into "actual" spatial work we'll need to load some libraries.

:::panel-tabset
## [{{< fa brands r-project >}} R]{.r}

Load `sf` to work with vector data.

```{r r-libs, warning = F, message = F}
# Load needed libraries
library(sf)
```

## [{{< fa brands python >}} Python]{.py}

Load the `geopandas` library to work with vector data. We'll also load the `os` library to deal with file path issues.

```{python py-libs}
# Load needed libraries
import os
import geopandas as gpd
```
