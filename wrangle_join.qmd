## Library & Data Loading

Begin by loading any needed libraries and reading in an external data file for use in downstream examples.

:::panel-tabset
## `r fontawesome::fa(name = "r-project", fill = "#FF9B00", a11y = "sem")` R

Load the `tidyverse` meta-package as well as our vertebrate data.

```{r r-start, warning = F, message = F}
# Load needed library
library(tidyverse)

# Load data
vert_r <- read.csv(file = "data/verts.csv")

# Check out first few rows
head(vert_r, n = 5)
```

## `r fontawesome::fa(name = "python", fill = "#077DC2", a11y = "sem")` Python

Load the Pandas library as well as our vertebrate data.

```{python py-libs}
# Load needed library
import pandas as pd

# Load data
vert_py = pd.read_csv("data/verts.csv")

# Check out first few rows
vert_py.head()
```
