Spatial operations have gotten _at ton_ of attention in both `r fontawesome::fa(name = "python", fill = "#077DC2", a11y = "sem")` [Python]{.py} and `r fontawesome::fa(name = "r-project", fill = "#FF9B00", a11y = "sem")` [R]{.r}! This website is mostly focused on translating between the two languages though so much of this nuance is not covered here. For those interested in a deeper dive in spatial computing, consider the following.

- `r fontawesome::fa(name = "r-project", fill = "#FF9B00", a11y = "sem")` [R]{.r} -- [Rachel King](https://github.com/king0708) created a really nice ["Spatial Data Visualization"](https://github.com/king0708/spatial-data-viz) workshop
- `r fontawesome::fa(name = "python", fill = "#077DC2", a11y = "sem")` [Python]{.py} -- The Arctic Data Center made a "Scalable and Computationally Reproducible Approaches to Arctic Resources" course that includes a ["Spatial and Image Data Using GeoPandas"](https://learning.nceas.ucsb.edu/2023-03-arctic/sections/geopandas.html#calculate-total-distance-per-fishing-area) chapter
