# R / Python Bilingualism

I think of myself as a competent R coder but am a total novice when it comes to Python. This repository is my attempt at forcing myself to 'eat my vegetables' and gain basic competency in Python. I think trying for a 1-to-1 R translation to Python will be an effective learning method.

## Additional Resources

I'm not the first to have this idea so there are other useful resources on this topic. See below:

- I've centralized some resources I've found in a (private) [GitHub repository](https://github.com/njlyon0/esiil_bilingualism). Open an issue if you feel you need access to this repository
