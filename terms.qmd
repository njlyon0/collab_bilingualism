## Overview

Learning a programming language is just like learning a spoken language: there are a lot of terms and definitions to learn! To complicate matters for an R / Python bilingualism context like this one, the two programming languages sometimes use the same term with very different definitions attached. To hopefully streamline term acquisition / comparison, I'm compiling a glossary of crucial R and Python terms below and (where applicable) re-capitulating the other languages' definition for terms that occur in both languages.

Note that if a given term **means the same thing in both languages**, no special mention is made of the other language.

### General

- **Variable** - any data object stored for later re-use
    - **<span style="color:#ff9b00">R</span>** - object
- **Assignment Operator (`=`)** - symbol used to assign data to a variable
    - **<span style="color:#ff9b00">R</span>** - same definition but uses `<-` or `->`
- **Type** - category of information contained in a variable
    - **<span style="color:#ff9b00">R</span>** - class
- **List** - fundamental data object of **<span style="color:#077dc2">Python</span>** potentially of many structures and types
    - Similar to a list _sensu_ **<span style="color:#ff9b00">R</span>** but not exactly the same
- **Length** - Multiple definitions, see below:
    - 1 - number of characters in a string (equivalent to 'number of characters' in **<span style="color:#ff9b00">R</span>**)
    - 2 - number of items in a list

### Variable Types

- **Integer** - "round" number
- **Float** - non-integer number
    - **<span style="color:#ff9b00">R</span>** - numeric
- **String** - text (or numbers stored as text)
    - **<span style="color:#ff9b00">R</span>** - character

## `r fontawesome::fa(name = "r-project", fill = "#FF9B00", a11y = "sem")` R Terms

### General

- **Object** - any data object stored for later re-use
    - **<span style="color:#077dc2">Python</span>** - variable
- **Assignment Operator (`<-`/`->`)** - symbol used to assign data to an object
    - **<span style="color:#077dc2">Python</span>** - same definition but uses `=`
- **Class** - category of information contained in an object
    - **<span style="color:#077dc2">Python</span>** - type
- **Vector** - fundamental data object of one dimension and a single class
    - Equivalent to the simplest possible list _sensu_ **<span style="color:#077dc2">Python</span>**
- **List** - generic data object that is ordered and may contain various data structures or classes
    - Similar to a list _sensu_ **<span style="color:#077dc2">Python</span>** but not exactly the same and not as fundamental in **<span style="color:#ff9b00">R</span>** as its equivalent in the other language
- **Length** - Number of entries in a vector

### Object Classes

- **Integer** - "round" number
- **Numeric** - non-integer number
     - **<span style="color:#077dc2">Python</span>** - float
- **Character** - text (or numbers stored as text)
     - **<span style="color:#077dc2">Python</span>** - string
