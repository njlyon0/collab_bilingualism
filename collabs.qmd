### Contributing Overview

A comprehensive and accessible coding bilingualism website like this one is a huge undertaking and I'd welcome collaborators who share my vision for the value of a resource like this. I'm a competent R coder but that definitely does not mean I am 100% correct all the time nor that I always write explanations in the clearest way possible. On the Python front, I'm a total novice largely reframing and recapitulating my take-aways from the tutorials that I'm taking.

So, if you'd like to collaborate with me on this I have the following guidelines (which I'm happy to discuss/modify with prospective collaborators!)

### Bug / Issue Reporting

If you see something wrong--either in a code chunk or in the plain text--I'd really appreciate it if you flagged it for my attention. You can do this by opening a {{< fa brands github >}} [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/njlyon0/collab_bilingualism/issues) on this project's repository. Please include the link to the page with the issue and as much detail as possible so I can easily find the problem area and make any needed repairs.

If you identify a bug in this manner I'll add your name and a link to the professional website of your choosing to the list below!

### Co-Development

If you'd like to actively collaborate with me on developing and refining this website that would be awesome! Please either reach out to me directly ([see my website](https://njlyon0.github.io/) for my contact info) or open a {{< fa brands github >}} [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/njlyon0/collab_bilingualism/issues) to get that conversation started.

I'm envisioning that each new collaborator would (1) [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the website's GitHub repository, (2) make any edits that they had in mind, and (3) then [submit a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to get those changes integrated into the primary website. I'm absolutely open to a [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches)-based alternative if that makes more sense and I anticipate refining the logistical elements of contributing once the development team includes more than just me.

### Contribution Credit

If you are interested/wiling to join me in refining this website, I believe that is absolutely worthy of formal credit. You'll notice that the top right of the navbar has a "Creators" dropdown menu. If you contribute substantively (i.e., more than indicating a simple bug fix) we can add your name and link it to the professional website of your choosing.

If you have other modes of properly acknowledging your contribution(s) I am absolutely open to discussing those ideas!
