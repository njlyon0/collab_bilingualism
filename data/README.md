# Bilingualism Data

Some modules require external data. When those data are relatively small (i.e., less than a few MB), they are committed to Git and are thus shared more directly with users of this website. Note that larger files (e.g., shapefiles, rasters, etc.) are ignored by Git (see the `.gitignore` for specific file extensions that are ignored). However, the modules that use those larger data files _still assume the data are found in this folder!_
