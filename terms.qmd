## Overview

Learning a programming language is just like learning a spoken language: there are a lot of terms and definitions to learn! To complicate matters for an R-Python bilingualism context like this one, the two programming languages sometimes use the same term with very different definitions attached. To hopefully streamline term acquisition / comparison, I'm compiling a glossary of crucial R and Python terms below and (where applicable) re-capitulating the other languages' definition for terms that occur in both languages.
