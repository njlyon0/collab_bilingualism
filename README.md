# R / Python Bilingualism

I think of myself as a competent R coder but am a total novice when it comes to Python. This repository is my attempt at forcing myself to 'eat my vegetables' and gain basic competency in Python. I think trying for a 1-to-1 R translation to Python will be an effective learning method.
