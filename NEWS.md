## Version 1.0.900

This is the development version of this website. Changes from the preceding version will be identified as they are made.

- No changes (yet!)

## Version 1.0

This is the first "full" version of the bilingualism website. "Full" is in quotes because there's not a clear endpoint for when all reasonable translations of Python/R operations would be included but this version of the website closely matches my initial goal in creating it.

Website currently includes:

- "Fundamentals" dropdown including (1) core concepts, (2) automation, (3) text methods, (4) packages and libraries, (5) directory management, and (6) external data
- "Data wrangling" dropdown including (1) subset, (2) summarize, (3) reshape, and (4) join
- "Visualization" dropdown including (1) grammar of graphics (i.e., `matplotlib`/`ggplot`)
- "Spatial" dropdown including (1) core, (2) raster, and (3) vector
- "SQL" page
- "Glossary" page
